# Background
### The question I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for the top-paying data analyst jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. What are the top high-paid skills ?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# Tools I Used
## Here are the programs I frequently used for data analysis:

### **SQL** (Structured Query Language):
- I used SQL to query and manipulate databases. This included tasks like filtering, joining, and aggregating data to extract meaningful insights. SQL allowed me to perform complex data retrievals, which were crucial for understanding patterns and trends in the datasets.

### **PostgreSQL** (Postgres):
- PostgreSQL served as my primary relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing and managing data. I used it to create and manage databases, ensuring data integrity and executing SQL queries efficiently. Its advanced features like indexing, transactions, and constraints supported robust data analysis.

### **VS Code** (Visual Studio Code):
- I used VS Code as my main code editor for writing and debugging SQL queries and scripts. Its extensions for SQL and Git integration helped streamline the development and version control process, making it easier to manage my workflow.

### **Git & GitHub**:
- Git and GitHub were used for version control and collaboration. I used Git to track changes in my scripts and data analysis projects, enabling me to revert to previous versions if needed. GitHub provided a platform to store my projects remotely, collaborate with others, and showcase my work.
# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market.
Here's how I approached each question: 
## 1. Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs.
I identified top 10 high-paid data analyst roles, focusing on remote jobs, job schedule types, job posted date, company name and id. 

```sql
SELECT
    job_postings_fact.job_id,
    company_dim.name,
    job_postings_fact.job_title,
    job_postings_fact.job_location,
    job_postings_fact.job_schedule_type,
    job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg,
    job_postings_fact.job_posted_date
    
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
where 
    job_title LIKE '%Data Analyst%'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
## Key Observations:
### Salary Disparities:

The salaries range from $181,000 to $650,000 annually. The highest-paying role is the Data Analyst position at Mantys, with an impressive $650,000 salary, far outpacing the others.
Roles in established tech companies like Pinterest and healthcare institutions like UCLA are listed at more moderate salaries, ranging from $217,000 to $232,423.

### Job Titles and Specialization:

The listed job titles range from generic ‚ÄúData Analyst‚Äù roles to more specialized titles like ‚ÄúPrincipal Data Analyst,‚Äù ‚ÄúSenior Data Analyst,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDirector, Data Analyst.‚Äù
More specialized or senior roles (e.g., Principal, Senior, Director) tend to come with higher compensation, reflecting the value placed on experience and leadership within the data analytics field.

### Employment Patterns by Industry:

Tech and finance companies like Pinterest, SmartAsset, and Patterned Learning AI dominate the list, showing that these sectors are heavily investing in data talent.
The listing also includes healthcare (UCLA) and communications (Zoom), indicating that data analytics is a cross-industry requirement.

        job_postings_fact.job_title,
        job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg
        
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim on company_dim.company_id = job_postings_fact.company_id
    where 
        job_title like '%Data Analyst%'
        and job_location = 'Anywhere'
        and salary_year_avg is not NULL

    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim on top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id

    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skills
HAVING 
    COUNT(job_postings_fact.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
    COUNT(job_postings_fact.job_id) DESC,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg)) DESC
LIMIT 10
```

### Key Insights:
![Golden Mean](assets/part_5.png)
*The chart above shows the relationship between job count and average salary for various skills in 2023.*

1. High Demand & High Salary:

- SQL has the highest job count (398) and a solid average salary ($97,237), making it both in demand and relatively well-compensated.

- Python and Tableau are similarly strong, with decent job counts (236 and 230) and average salaries just over $100,000.

2. High Salary & Lower Demand:
- Looker stands out with the highest average salary ($103,795) but has one of the lowest job counts (49). This indicates a specialized skill with high pay but fewer available positions.
- R and SAS offer strong average salaries (around $100,000) with moderate demand, indicating their continued relevance in specific data roles.

3. Lower Salary & Lower Demand:
- Word and PowerPoint are on the lower end of both job count and average salary, highlighting that these general skills are less valued in specialized roles like data analysis.
